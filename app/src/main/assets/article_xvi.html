<p align="center">Official Ballots and Election Returns</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 181. Official ballots. &#8211; Ballots for national and local offices shall be of uniform size and color and shall be provided at public expense. They shall be printed on paper with watermarks or other marks that will readily distinguish the ballot paper from ordinary paper. Each ballot shall be in the shape of a strip with stub and detachable coupon containing the serial number of the ballot, and a space for the thumbmark of the voter on the detachable coupon. It shall bear at the top on the middle portion thereof the coat of arms of the Republic of the Philippines, the words &#8220;Official Ballot&#8221;, the name of the city or the municipality and province in which the election is held, the date of the election, and the following notice: &#8220;Fill out this ballot secretly inside the voting booth. Do not put any distinctive mark on any part of this ballot.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ballot shall also contain the names of all the offices to be voted for in the election, allowing opposite the name of each office, sufficient space or spaces with horizontal lines where the voter may write the name or names of the individual candidates voted for by him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There shall not be anything on the reverse side of the ballot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ballots in cities and municipalities where Arabic is of general use shall have each of the titles of offices to be voted printed in Arabic in addition to and immediately below the English title.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, the Commission is hereby empowered to prescribe a different form of ballot to facilitate voting by illiterate voters and to use or adopt the latest technological and electronic devices as authorized under paragraph (i) of Section 52 hereof. (Sec. 128, 1978 EC, with modification)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 182. Emergency ballots. &#8211; No ballots other than the official ballots shall be used or counted, except in the event of failure to receive the official ballots on time, or where there are no sufficient ballots for all registered voters or where they are destroyed at such time as shall render it impossible to provide other official ballots, in which cases the city or municipal treasurer shall provide other ballots which shall be as similar to the official ones as circumstances will permit and which shall be uniform within each polling place. The treasurer shall immediately report such action to the Commission.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The municipal treasurer shall not undertake the preparation of the emergency ballots unless the political parties, candidates and the organizations collectively authorized by the Commission to designate watchers have been sufficiently notified to send their representatives and have agreed in writing to the preparation and use of emergency ballots. (Sec. 130, 1978 EC; Sec. 30, BP 697)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 183. Requisition of official ballots and election returns. &#8211; Official ballots and election returns shall be printed upon orders of the Commission. Requisition of official ballots shall be for each city and municipality, at the rate of one and one-fifth ballots for every registered voter in the next preceding election; and for election returns, at one set thereof for every polling place. (Sec. 166, 1971 EC; Sec. 31, BP 697)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 184. Printing of official ballots and election returns. &#8211; The official ballots and election returns shall be printed by the Government Printing Office and/or the Central Bank printing facilities exclusively, under the exclusive supervision and control of the Commission which shall determine and provide the necessary security measures in the printing, storage and distribution thereof.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each ballot shall be joined by a perforated line to a stub numbered consecutively, beginning with number &#8220;1&#8221; in each city and municipality. Each ballot shall also have at the bottom a detachable coupon bearing the same number of the stub. Each pad of ballots shall bear on its cover the name of the city or municipality in which the ballots are to be used and the inclusive serial numbers of the ballots contained therein.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The official ballots shall be bound in separate pads of fifty or one hundred ballots each as may be required.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The election returns shall be prepared in sets of six copies per set and shall be numbered consecutively, beginning with number &#8220;1&#8221; in each city and municipality. Each set of the election returns shall be printed in such a manner that will ensure that the entries on the original of the returns are clearly reproduced on the other copies thereof and shall bear the name of the city or municipality in which the returns are to be used. For this purpose, the Commission shall acquire, if necessary, a special kind of carbon paper or chemically treated paper. (Sec. 163, 1971 EC; Sec. 129, 1978 EC, with modifications)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 185. Official Sample Ballots. &#8211; The Commission shall provide the board of election inspectors with official sample ballots at the rate of thirty (30) ballots per polling place. The official sample ballots shall be printed on colored paper, in all respects like the official ballots but bearing instead the words &#8216;Official Sample Ballot&#8217; to be shown to the public and used in demonstrating how to fill out and fold the official ballots properly. No name of any actual candidate shall be written on the spaces for voting on the official sample ballots provided by the Commission, nor shall they be used for voting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At least thirty (30) days before an election, it shall be the duty of the Commission on Elections to furnish every registered voter through registered mail with return card, personal service with corresponding receipt to be signed by the voter or any person who knows the voter, or any other practicable means with an unfilled official sample ballot, voter information sheet, and a list of all registered national, provincial and city candidates to be voted in the said election. The information sheet shall include the voter&#8217;s name, address, the precinct and the place where he is registered, and simplified instructions as to the casting of votes. The names of the candidates shall be listed in alphabetical order under their respective party affiliation and a one-line statement not to exceed three (3) words of their occupation or profession: Provided, however, That in the printing of the names of the candidates for national offices, the alphabetical order shall be democratized so that the listed names shall be made in three (3) columns: the first column shall commence with the letter A and end with the letter Z; the second column shall commence with the letters &#8216;I-Z&#8217; and thereafter &#8211; &#8216;A-H&#8217; and the third column shall commence with the letters &#8216;Q-Z&#8217; and thereafter &#8216;A-P&#8217;. These information may be contained in a single sheet or booklet form, and the number and location of the voters&#8217; polling place shall be prominently indicated therein. Persons nominated under the party-list system likewise be included in the abovementioned list.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 186. Distribution of official ballots and election returns. &#8211; The official ballots and the election returns shall be distributed by the Commission to each city and municipality at the rate of one and one-fifth ballots for every voter registered in each polling place; and for election returns, at the rate of one set each for every polling place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The provincial, city or municipal treasurer shall respectively keep a record of the quantity and serial numbers of official ballots and election returns furnished the various provinces, cities, municipalities and polling places, as the case may be, legible copies of which record shall be furnished the duly authorized provincial, city or municipal representatives of the ruling party and the dominant opposition party, and the Commission immediately after the distribution is made of such official ballots and election returns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Commission shall prescribe the use of official delivery receipts to be signed by the election registrar and the chairman of the board of canvassers upon receipt of the election returns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No official ballots or election returns shall be delivered to the board of election inspectors earlier than the first hour of election day: Provided, however, That the Commission, after written notice to the registered political parties and the candidates, may, for justifiable reasons, authorize the delivery of said official ballots and election returns to the board of election inspectors of any particular polling place at an earlier date. (Sec. 31, BP 697)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 187. Committee on printing, storage, and distribution of official ballots and election returns. &#8211; The Commission shall appoint a committee of five members, two of whom shall be from among its personnel, the third to be designated by the Commission on Audit, and the last two to be designated by the ruling party and the dominant opposition party to act as its representatives in supervising the printing, storage and distribution of official ballots and election returns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upon the request of any candidate, political party or of civic, religious, professional, business, service, youth or any similar organizations collectively designated by the Commission, the latter shall allow any person designated by any of the former as watcher to observe the proceedings of the committee on the printing of official ballots and election returns, file objections, if any, witness the printing and distribution of the ballots and the returns and guard the premises of the printer. (Sec. 32, BP 697, with modifications)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 188. Duties of the committee on printing of official ballots and election returns. &#8211; Under such orders or instructions as the Commission may issue, and in addition to general supervision and control over the printing and shipment of official ballots and election returns, the committee on printing of official ballots and election returns shall (a) take charge of the room or rooms where the paper and paraphernalia used in the printing of official ballots and election returns are stored and where printed official ballots and election returns are packed and prepared for shipment, (b) supervise all aspects relating to the printing, storage and shipment of official ballots and election returns and report to the Commission any irregularity which they believe may have been committed, and (c) perform such other related functions as the Commission may direct. (Sec. 32, BP 697)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 189. Representatives of the registered political parties in the verification and distribution of official ballots and election returns. &#8211; The ruling party and the dominant opposition party or their respective duly authorized representatives in the different provinces, cities and municipalities, shall submit the names of their respective watchers who, together with the representatives of the Commission and the provincial, city and municipal treasurer shall verify the contents of the boxes containing the shipment of official ballots, election returns and sample official ballots received by the said treasurers. The provincial treasurers shall keep a record of their receipt and distribution to each municipal treasurer, while the city and municipal treasurer shall each keep a record of their distribution to the board of election inspectors. (Sec. 34, BP 697, with modifications)</p>
