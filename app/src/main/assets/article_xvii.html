<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 190. Voting hours. &#8211; The casting of votes shall start at seven o&#8217;clock in the morning and shall end at three o&#8217;clock in the afternoon, except when there are voters present within thirty meters in front of the polling place who have not yet cast their votes, in which case the voting shall continue but only to allow said voters to cast their votes without interruption. The poll clerk shall, without delay, prepare a complete list containing the names of said voters consecutively numbered, and the voters so listed shall be called to vote by announcing each name repeatedly three times in the order in which they are listed. Any voter in the list who is not present when his name is called out shall not be permitted to vote. (Sec. 35, BP 697)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 191. Preliminaries to the voting. &#8211; (a) The board of election inspectors shall meet at the polling place at six-thirty o&#8217;clock in the morning of election day and shall have the book of voters containing all the approved applications of registration of voters pertaining to the polling place, the certified list of voters, the certified list of candidates, the ballot box, the official ballots, sufficient indelible pencils or ball pens for the use of the voters, the forms to be used, and all other materials which may be necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(b) Immediately thereafter, the chairman of the board of election inspectors shall open the ballot box, empty both of its compartments, exhibit them to all those present and being empty, lock its interior covers with three padlocks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(c) The chairman shall forthwith show to the public and the watchers present the package of official ballots received from the city, or municipal treasurer duly wrapped and sealed and the number of pads, the serial numbers and the type forms of the ballots in each pad appearing on the cover, and the book of voters duly sealed. The board of election inspectors shall then break the seals of the package of official ballots and the book of voters. The board of election inspectors shall enter in the minutes the fact that the package of ballots, and the book of voters were shown to the public with their wrapping and corresponding seals intact and/or if they find that the wrapping and seals are broken, such fact must be stated in the minutes as well as the number of pads and the serial numbers of ballots that they find in the package.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ballots with separately printed serial numbers shall be deemed spurious and shall not be utilized by the board of election inspectors unless the Commission representative shall order their use in writing, stating the reasons therefor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(d) The chairman and the two party members of the board of election inspectors shall retain in their possession their respective keys to the padlocks during the voting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(e) The box shall remain locked until the voting is finished and the counting begins. However, if it should become necessary to make room for more ballots, the board of election inspectors may open the box in the presence of the whole board of election inspectors and the watchers, and the chairman shall press down with his hands the ballots contained therein without removing any of them, after which the board of election inspectors shall close the box and lock it with three padlocks as hereinbefore provided. (Sec. 136, 1978 EC)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 192.

<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 193. Order of voting. &#8211; The voters shall vote in the order of their entrance into the polling place. The voters shall have the right to freely enter the polling place as soon as they arrive unless there are voters waiting inside, in which case they shall fall in line in the order of their arrival and shall not crowd around the table of the board of election inspectors.

<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 194.

If the board of election inspectors is satisfied with his identity, the chairman shall distinctly announce the voter&#8217;s name in a tone loud enough to be plainly heard throughout the polling place. If such voter has not been challenged, or if having been challenged, the question has been decided in his favor, the voter shall forthwith affix his signature in the proper space in the voting record, and the chairman shall, after first entering the number of the ballot in the corresponding space of the voting record, deliver to the voter one ballot correctly folded.

It shall likewise be unlawful to use carbon paper, paraffin paper, or other means for making a copy of the contents of the ballot or make use of any other means to identify the vote of the voter. (Sec. 140, 1978 EC)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 196. Preparation of ballots for illiterate and disabled persons. &#8211; A voter who is illiterate or physically unable to prepare the ballot by himself may be assisted in the preparation of his ballot by a relative, by affinity or consanguinity within the fourth civil degree or if he has none, by any person of his confidence who belong to the same household or any member of the board of election inspectors, except the two party members: Provided, That no voter shall be allowed to vote as illiterate or physically disabled unless it is so indicated in his registration record: Provided, further, That in no case shall an assistor assist more than three times except the non-party members of the board of election inspectors. The person thus chosen shall prepare the ballot for the illiterate or disabled voter inside the voting booth. The person assisting shall bind himself in a formal document under oath to fill out the ballot strictly in accordance with the instructions of the voter and not to reveal the contents of the ballot prepared by him. Violation of this provision shall constitute an election offense. (Sec. 141, 1978 EC)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 197. Spoiled ballots. &#8211; If a voter should accidentally spoil or deface a ballot in such a way that it cannot lawfully be used, he shall surrender if folded to the chairman who shall note in the corresponding space in the voting record that said ballot is spoiled. The voter shall then be entitled to another ballot which the chairman shall give him after announcing the serial number of the second ballot and recording said serial number in the corresponding spaces in the voting record. If the second ballot is again spoiled or defaced in such a way that it cannot lawfully be used, the same shall be surrendered to the chairman and recorded in the same manner as the first spoiled or defaced ballot. However, no voter shall change his ballot more than twice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The spoiled ballot shall, without being unfolded and without removing the detachable coupon, be distinctly marked with the word &#8220;spoiled&#8221; and signed by the board of election inspectors on the indorsement fold thereof and immediately placed in the compartment for spoiled ballots. (Sec. 142, 1978 EC)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 198. Voting. &#8211; (a) After the voter has filled his ballot he shall fold it in the same manner as when he received it and return it to the chairman.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">(d) The voter shall forthwith affix his thumbmark by the side of his signature in the space intended for that purpose in the voting record and the chairman shall apply silver nitrate and commassie blue on the right forefinger nail or on any other available finger nail, if there be no forefinger nail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(e) The chairman shall sign in the proper space beside the thumbmark of the voter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(f)The chairman, after finding everything to be in order, shall then detach the coupon in the presence of the board of election inspectors and of the voter and shall deposit the folded ballot in the compartment for valid ballots, and the detached coupon in the compartment for spoiled ballots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(g)The voter shall then depart.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any ballot returned to the chairman whose detachable coupon has been removed not in the presence of the board of election inspectors and of the voter, or any ballot whose number does not coincide with the number of the ballot delivered to the voter, as entered in the voting record, shall be considered as spoiled and shall be so marked and signed by the members of the board of election inspectors. (Sec. 143, 1978 EC)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 199. Challenge of illegal voters. &#8211; (a) Any voter, or watcher may challenge any person offering to vote for not being registered, for using the name of another or suffering from existing disqualification. In such case, the board of election inspectors shall satisfy itself as to whether or not the ground for the challenge is true by requiring proof of registration or the identity of the voter; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(b) No voter shall be required to present his voter&#8217;s affidavit on election day unless his identity is challenged. His failure or inability to produce his voter&#8217;s affidavit upon being challenged, shall not preclude him from voting if his identity be shown from the photograph, fingerprints, or specimen signatures in his approved application in the book of voters or if he is identified under oath by a member of the board of election inspectors and such identification shall be reflected in the minutes of the board.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 200. Challenge based on certain illegal acts. &#8211; Any voter or watcher may challenge any voter offering to vote on the ground that the challenged person has received or expects to receive, has paid, offered or promised to pay, has contributed, offered or promised to contribute money or anything of value as consideration for his vote or for the vote of another; that he has made or received a promise to influence the giving or withholding of any such vote or that he has made a bet or is interested directly or indirectly in a bet which depends upon the result of the election. The challenged person shall take a prescribed oath before the board of election inspectors that he has not committed any of the acts alleged in the challenge. Upon the taking of such oath, the challenge shall be dismissed and the challenged voter shall be allowed to vote, but in case of his refusal to take such oath, the challenge shall be sustained and he shall not be allowed to vote. (Sec. 145, 1978 EC)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 201.

(Sec. 146, 1978 EC)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 202.
