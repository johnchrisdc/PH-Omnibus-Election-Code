<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 60. Political party. &#8211; &#8220;Political party&#8221; or &#8220;party&#8221;, when used in this Act, means an organized group of persons pursuing the same ideology, political ideas or platforms of government and includes its branches and divisions. To acquire juridical personality, qualify it for subsequent accreditation, and to entitle it to the rights and privileges herein granted to political parties, a political party shall first be duly registered with the Commission. Any registered political party that, singly or in coalition with others, fails to obtain at least ten percent of the votes cast in the constituency in which it nominated and supported a candidate or candidates in the election next following its registration shall, after notice and hearing, be deemed to have forfeited such status as a registered political party in such constituency. (Sec. 22, 1971 EC, with amendments)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 61. Registration. &#8211; Any organized group of persons seeking registration as a national or regional political party may file with the Commission a verified petition attaching thereto its constitution and by-laws, platform or program of government and such other relevant information as may be required by the Commission. The Commission shall, after due notice and hearing, resolve the petition within ten days from the date it is submitted for decision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No religious sect shall be registered as a political party and no political party which seeks to achieve its goal through violence shall be entitled to accreditation. (New; Sec. 2 and 8, Art. XII-C, Const.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SECTION 62. Publication of petition for registration or accreditation. &#8211; The Commission shall require publication of the petition for registration or accreditation in at least three newspapers of general circulation and shall, after due notice and hearing, resolve the petition within fifteen days from the date it is submitted for decision.
